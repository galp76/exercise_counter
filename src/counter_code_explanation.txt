Explanation:

    HTML structure:

        A text input box with id="counter" is created, set to readonly to prevent direct editing.

        Two buttons are added with id="increment" and id="decrement".

    JavaScript code:

        counter, incrementButton, and decrementButton variables are obtained from the DOM using getElementById().

        count is initialized to 0.

        Event listeners are attached to the buttons:

            When incrementButton is clicked, count is increased by 1 and the counter value is updated.

            When decrementButton is clicked, count is decreased by 1 and the counter value is updated.

How it works:

    When you click the "Increment" button, the JavaScript code increments the count variable and updates the value of the counter input box.

    When you click the "Decrement" button, the JavaScript code decrements the count variable and updates the value of the counter input box.

This code provides a simple counter with increment and decrement buttons, effectively showcasing the interaction between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
